# Home network backend

### Concept

The goal of this project is to build a heterogenous home IoT system in a modular manner. This would allow for learning essential or promising skills in and around the field of IoT and more broadly IT.

There is a folder for the services written in a specfic language.
Pre-built services can be found in the services folder.

### Running

Use docker-compose to run the whole application as every service should run containerized.

Kubernetes to be implemented.

### Communication framework

Currently, only an MQTT system is set-up. However it is planned to increase this number.
